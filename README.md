# Make Your Own Programming Language in 30 Minutes

... is the title of a talk that I gave, which is about exactly
what it sounds like. This repository contains the written version -
each commit is a working version of the code that I build up in that talk
(and a little bit more, because I'm not constrained by time here), liberally
commented. Hopefully this will be useful and/or interesting to someone.

The commit messages are also very detailed, so be sure to read those as well.

## Contributing

Contributions are absolutely welcome! Since this repository uses the commits
and commit messages to break the program down into easy, manageable steps,
please don't just submit pull requests. Send in patches for the commit(s) you
want to amend, and I'll rebase the repository to include them.
